FP1 - Summative #1 - Dictionaries Program

You will be creating a simple program that uses lists and dictionaries and their functions to accomplish a task. Make sure your program has at least one list and two or three dictionaries, and can use various array methods to do that work such as :

Appending
Modifying a value
Adding a key:value item
Deleting
Length
Return values
Add values
Return keys
Return items
Get
Pop

You can make a simple inventory program, a student marks program, a simple attack/defend program, an English to Pirate translator, or anything else you wish. Your program should use and display items in your lists and dictionaries effectively. This should be a simple program, so donâ€™t spends loads of time.
